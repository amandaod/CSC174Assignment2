            My name is Jacob Lee and I am currently a senior at the University of Rochester. I’m majoring in Computer Science and plan
            to graduate this May with a Bachelor of Science. I have a passion for transforming innovative ideas to seamless
            and elegant web applications. When I was a high schooler, I held a plethora of different jobs such as yogurt,
            smoothie, and bubble tea making, chicken serving, and SAT teaching. Two summers ago I worked at ClassLink as
            a Junior Developer Intern and would say that it wasn’t a pleasant experience as I did not have much mentorship.
            However, I still learned a lot by myself through stackoverflow and learning from my mistakes. The experience
            was so awful that I thought I would hate the software engineering industry.
