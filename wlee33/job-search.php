        <h1> JOB SEARCH </h1>
        <p>
            I had to study data structures and algorithms very extensively and this made me wish I studied harder during CSC 172. I submitted
            more than 200 applications, from which I was ghosted by more than half of them. Flying out to the final onsite
            interviews was a huge hassle as well, as I always had layover flights. These interviews also occurred untimely
            during important exams I had the following week. It was difficult to allocate my time to both interview prep
            and exams as I really wanted to land a job but I had to pass the exams to be able to graduate.
