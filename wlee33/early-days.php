        <h1> EARLY DAYS </h1>
        <p>
            I thought that the BS program in the University of Rochester is quite challenging as I struggled through many of the core
            courses, most notably CSC 282 and 252. However, I have fortunately gotten through all of them and only need one
            more 200 level course to graduate and have decided to take CSC 261 as this final course. For my advanced CS course
            electives, I decided to concentrate on web and mobile programming as Iâ€™ve taken CSC 210 and 214. I was born in
            Korea and spent most of my childhood in underdeveloped countries such as the Papua New Guinea and the Philippines.
            So when I came to the United States in elementary school, I was fascinated by the prevalence of computers and
            their sheer power. All I thought about was the next time I could go on a computer and start making stick fights
            using this old program called Scratch. I think it was this stark contrast between being in such underdeveloped
            countries and coming to the US and seeing all this accessible and cool technology that made me interested in
            programming and computers in general.
