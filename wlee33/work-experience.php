        <h1> WORK EXPERIENCE </h1>
        <p>
            Last summer, I worked at Ellucian as a Software Developer Intern. Thankfully in this second internship, I had a very solid
            mentorship as it was a much bigger company and had a very enriching and invaluable experience. This internship
            definitely revitalized my love for the industry. Most recently, I worked as a Teaching Assistant for CSC 210
            and also landed a full-time software engineering job in Boston which I will start in July. The interview process
            for a full-time job was very difficult compared to the search for an internship.
