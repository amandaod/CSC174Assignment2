            My name is Jacob Lee and I am currently a senior at the University of Rochester. I’m majoring in Computer Science and plan
            to graduate this May with a Bachelor of Science. I have a passion for transforming innovative ideas to seamless
            and elegant web applications. When I was a high schooler, I held a plethora of different jobs such as yogurt,
            smoothie, and bubble tea making, chicken serving, and SAT teaching. Two summers ago I worked at ClassLink as
            a Junior Developer Intern and would say that it wasn’t a pleasant experience as I did not have much mentorship.
            However, I still learned a lot by myself through stackoverflow and learning from my mistakes. The experience
            was so awful that I thought I would hate the software engineering industry.
        </p>
        <h1> EARLY DAYS </h1>
        <p>
            I thought that the BS program in the University of Rochester is quite challenging as I struggled through many of the core
            courses, most notably CSC 282 and 252. However, I have fortunately gotten through all of them and only need one
            more 200 level course to graduate and have decided to take CSC 261 as this final course. For my advanced CS course
            electives, I decided to concentrate on web and mobile programming as I’ve taken CSC 210 and 214. I was born in
            Korea and spent most of my childhood in underdeveloped countries such as the Papua New Guinea and the Philippines.
            So when I came to the United States in elementary school, I was fascinated by the prevalence of computers and
            their sheer power. All I thought about was the next time I could go on a computer and start making stick fights
            using this old program called Scratch. I think it was this stark contrast between being in such underdeveloped
            countries and coming to the US and seeing all this accessible and cool technology that made me interested in
            programming and computers in general.
        </p>
        <h1> JOB SEARCH </h1>
        <p>
            I had to study data structures and algorithms very extensively and this made me wish I studied harder during CSC 172. I submitted
            more than 200 applications, from which I was ghosted by more than half of them. Flying out to the final onsite
            interviews was a huge hassle as well, as I always had layover flights. These interviews also occurred untimely
            during important exams I had the following week. It was difficult to allocate my time to both interview prep
            and exams as I really wanted to land a job but I had to pass the exams to be able to graduate.
        </p>
        <h1> WORK EXPERIENCE </h1>
        <p>
            Last summer, I worked at Ellucian as a Software Developer Intern. Thankfully in this second internship, I had a very solid
            mentorship as it was a much bigger company and had a very enriching and invaluable experience. This internship
            definitely revitalized my love for the industry. Most recently, I worked as a Teaching Assistant for CSC 210
            and also landed a full-time software engineering job in Boston which I will start in July. The interview process
            for a full-time job was very difficult compared to the search for an internship.
