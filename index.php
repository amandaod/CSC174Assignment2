        <p>I am a student here at University of Rochester finishing up my major in Brain & Cognitive Sciences as well
            as minors in Computer Science and Psychology. I knew coming into college that I wanted to major in Brain &
            Cognitive Sciences because it seemed like a combination of biology and psychology—two subjects I had loved
            in high school. I had originally planned on double majoring in psychology along with my Brain & Cognitive
            Sciences major, but when I took The Science of Programming (CSC 171) as part of my Brain & Cognitive
            Sciences program I loved it and decided to stick with it. I’m very glad I took that class early on in my
            college career so that I was able to add a Computer Science minor and explore that newfound interest.</p>

            My name is Jacob Lee and I am currently a senior at the University of Rochester. I’m majoring in Computer
            Science and plan to graduate this May with a Bachelor of Science. I have a passion for transforming
            innovative ideas to seamless and elegant web applications. When I was a high schooler, I held a plethora of
            different jobs such as yogurt, smoothie, and bubble tea making, chicken serving, and SAT teaching. Two
            summers ago I worked at ClassLink as a Junior Developer Intern and would say that it wasn’t a pleasant
            experience as I did not have much mentorship. However, I still learned a lot by myself through
            stackoverflow and learning from my mistakes. The experience was so awful that I thought I would hate the
            software engineering industry.

            I am currently a 4th year student at the University of Rochester studying both Computer Science and
            Anthropology. I was born in Fort Worth, Texas, but have lived in Hawaii (where one of my sisters was born)
            and New Jersey (where my other sister was born). I grew up mostly in Bergen County, NJ, especially within
            the Korean-American enclave of Palisades Park. Growing up I was always fascinated by computers and how they
            worked. I remember milestones like the process of installing my first graphics card, and learning how to
            mod video games.This semester, I am taking CSC174 and CSC 261. I hope to learn more advanced concepts of
            front-end development from 174, and gain a more intricate understanding of relational databases through
            261.
