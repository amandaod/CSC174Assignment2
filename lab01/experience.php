        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>
            For the summer of 2018, I worked at a summer educational program as their C.S instructor. My job involved
            teaching middle schoolers the basics of computer science. I taught the basics principles of computer
            science, such as the purpose of writing algorithms, as well as introductory programming skills in Python.
            By the end of the summer, my students were able to write loops and conditionals in Python, as well as
            knowing how to utilize arrays and other data types. I also maintained the technology within the
            institution. It was a great opportunity, as besides teaching being something that I enjoy, it gave me to
            opportunity to keep engaged with computer science over the summer.
