        <h2>Early Days</h2>
        <p>
            I went to high school at Academes@Englewood in Englewood, New Jersey. I had first interaction with web
            development, and computer science as a whole, during my freshman year of high school. It was an “Intro to
            Technology” class, and we made a (very simple) webpage, with only HTML and no CSS. I remember my topic was
            George Washington Carver, and it was a simple webpage with an image and text, with no styling. Senior of
            high school I had my first computer-related internship, at KAB computers. While the job itself involved
            little programming, I was able to get a great sense of the type and scope of software various types of
            businesses need. During that job I shadowed employees as they worked in places like government buildings
            and large businesses.
