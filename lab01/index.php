        <p>
            I am currently a 4th year student at the University of Rochester studying both Computer Science and
            Anthropology. I was born in Fort Worth, Texas, but have lived in Hawaii (where one of my sisters was born)
            and New Jersey (where my other sister was born). I grew up mostly in Bergen County, NJ, especially within
            the Korean-American enclave of Palisades Park. Growing up I was always fascinated by computers and how they
            worked. I remember milestones like the process of installing my first graphics card, and learning how to
            mod video games.This semester, I am taking CSC174 and CSC 261. I hope to learn more advanced concepts of
            front-end development from 174, and gain a more intricate understanding of relational databases through
            261.
