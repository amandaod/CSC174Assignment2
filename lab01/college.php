        <h2>College</h2>
        <p>
            During college, I had initially selected Anthropology as my major, but during sophomore I resolved to get a
            degree in computer science as well. Aside from the core pre-requisites, I had, and am currently taking
            courses focusing on web development. For example, CSC170 was a great exploration of the basics of front-end
            web development, such as HTML and CSS, as well as an excellent introduction to some of the more complex
            ideas, such scripting and web metrics. CSC210 was a course that covered the both the back end and the front
            end aspects of development, and its final project involved making a website from scratch. My group’s final
            project was called Smart Scheduler, and was a web app that automated the scheduling of a user’s event. It
            was a good introduction to the team dynamics of building a website, as well as how different programming
            let’s say a server versus the user interface.
